The requirements.txt file is a text file used to list all the Python packages that are required to run the project. This file allows you to easily specify the dependencies of your project, so that others can easily install the required packages to run your code.

When someone clones or downloads your project, they can simply run pip install -r requirements.txt to install all the necessary packages listed in the file. This makes it easier for others to set up and run your code without having to manually install each package one by one.

It's good practice to maintain a requirements.txt file in your project, as it helps ensure that all the necessary dependencies are installed and that your code can be run in different environments without issues.
